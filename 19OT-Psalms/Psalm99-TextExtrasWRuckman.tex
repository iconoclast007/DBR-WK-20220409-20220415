day” (2 Pet. 3:10) that is the “ day of days”
on God the Father’s calendar. Naturally, He
is going to give it more space, time, and
attention than anything else in His Book. Our
“day” is the day that God’s Son laid down
His life for us, but that is not the day that
interests the Father. The day He wants to see
is when His Son receives what rightfully
belongs to Him: glory, honor, power,
strength, dominion, and worship or as the
heavenly hosts put it: “Worthy is the Lamb
that was slain to receive power, and riches,
and wisdom, and strength, and honour,
and glory, and blessing” (Rev. 5:12).
You can count on the Calvinists to foul the
waters till a catfish couldn’t survive in them \cite{Ruckman1992psalms}:
\begin{compactenum}
\item Mt. Zion is now the church because it is God’s “favorite palace.”
\item The whole earth (in 1000 B.C. or A.D. 1880) should feel the “awe” of God sitting in heaven as a universal “Monarch.”
\item The “rule of God” can be perceived and “felt” by Christians in 1880 (Spurgeon, Treasury, p. 222).
\item The subject of the Psalm is Christ’s “mediatorial reign” and “those who are honored to lead the church of God”
(Treasury, p. 222).
\end{compactenum}
“He sitteth between the cherubims.” God is
sitting there now (see Rev. 4:6–9). How did
the “Champions” at Liberty University—who
had a participant in the Miss America contest
of 1990—miss that? With his “affection on
things above” (not “mind,” as in the NKJV,
Col. 3:1--3), how did Kroll fail to locate God
and the cherubims “above”? Remarkable,
isn’t it? The “mercy seat” was called a
“seat” for some reason (Num. 7:89), and
since Satan intends to enter the Temple in
Jerusalem and sit down (2 Thess. 2:4), why
would he not sit down in the place reserved
for God? After all, that was his intention
when he was a cherub (Isa. 14:13; Ezek.
28:14).
Didn’t any of the commentators know that
Satan has a “seat” (Rev. 2:13)? God sat
“between the cherubims” in the Tabernacle
in the wilderness, for that is the place from
where He communed with Moses (Exod.
25:22). How did Kroll miss that? All he can
mumble is, “God is represented as sitting
between the cherubims, which were never
heard of again after the Babylonian captivity.”
Awesome.
When Jesus Christ returns, He is pictured as
sitting “between the cherubims” (Ezek.
1:20–28).
Not one commentator from 1611 to 1992
could find the Scriptural application of the
verse. Unbelief; pure infidelity, just as blatant
and unabashed as Madalyn Murray O’Hair or
the ACLU. All you have to do is dump in the
supernatural, and out goes the bottom of the
grocery bag.
There are two phases to Christ’s return. One
of these is pictured as a man seated on a
threshing machine of some kind, which has
wheels and cherubims. The seated driver is on
a machine that is “excellent in working,” and
it grinds everything under it to pieces (Isa.
28:27–29). The other picture is a leader of
Cavalry on a white Arabian charger
composed of fire (Rev. 19:11). The
references for these pictures of the Second
Advent are in Joel 2:1–12; Habakkuk 3:9–16;
Revelation 19:11–16; 2 Samuel 22; Isaiah
63:1–6; and Ezekiel 1:2–26. When these
things take place, “the people tremble”
(literally), and the earth is “moved,” literally
(see Ps. 18:7, 46:6 and comments). For all
that you and I know, the literal cherubims will
be actually standing around the throne of
David when Jesus Christ sits down on it in
the Millennium. After all, the prayer was,
“thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in
earth, as it is in heaven” (Matt. 6:10). Well,
bless my soul, in heaven (Rev. 4:6–9), the
cherubims are around the throne (Rev. 5:6)!
God was
sitting “between the cherubims” before
Genesis 1:2, and He is sitting there right now
in 2002. Why would the ark of the covenant,
built in 1500 B.C., have to be “in existence”?
They have a time of it, don’t they?}

righteousness” show up again (vs. 4), as in
Psalm 9:8, 33:5, 37:6, and 72:2. The
“equity” of verse 4 is the “equity” of the
preceding Psalm (Ps. 98:9). The word means
“in a correct or upright fashion.” That is, a
fashion that is the exact opposite of court
procedures in America today (see comments
under Ps. 94:20). \cite{Ruckman1992psalms}}

There is no reference to anything ``heavenly,'' as the Calvinists put it (see Ps. 110:1--3 and Matt. 5:35). This footstool is located at a specific place on this earth: ``at his holy hill'' (vs. 9). His name is holy (vs. 3), ``he is holy'' (vs. 5), and His hill is holy (vs. 9). It is holy because He is sitting on it. Modern commentators cannot say one word about ``his holy hill.'' As soon as they heard about a specific place for worship--on a mountain, at that (John 4:20) --they came apart at the seams (Matt. 9:16). They knew they could not apply the New Testament precept given by Jesus Christ in John 4:21, so their Scrabble boards fell of the table, and all the letters with them. \cite{Ruckman1992psalms}}

Moses, Aaron, and Samuel are no exceptions. There has been only one exception in six thousand years of recorded history, in spite of the Darwinistic pipe dream about ``every day in every way, things are getting better and better.'' The world has never seen another man like Jesus Christ since He went back to glory. No one has seen one man who even resembled Him when it came to the matter of sinlessness \cite{Ruckman1992psalms}.

\item Moody and Spurgeon were gluttons who were forty pounds overweight; 
\item Norris would cuss on occasions; 
\item Billy Graham would soft soap the religious liberals; 
\item Billy Sunday (in absolute disregard for Jude 9) would challenge the devil to take him on; 
\item Luther would drink beer and joke about it; 
\item Peter cursed; 
\item Joseph lied about the cup; 
\item Noah got drunk; 
\item David committed adultery; and 
\item Paul (the worst in the lot) deliberately rebelled against the revealed will of God after being shown God's mind about the matter FIVE times (Acts 19--22). 
\item Samuel, one of
the most godly men who ever lived, appointed
his sons as judges in Israel (1 Sam. 8:1) when
they were not fit to be lawyers (1 Sam. 8:3).
The bitter fruit of this was a demand from the
people for a king, who in turn was one of the
greatest types of the Son of Perdition found
anywhere in the Scripture. They chose a
murderer who was a suicidal maniac.

When it comes to sin, John Paul II can keep up with Adolph Hitler; Elvis Presley was just as rotten as Charles Manson; Mother Teresa can give Bloody Mary a ``run for her money''; and there is no difference between Nelson Mandela and Jim Jones. Moses lost his temper, murdered a man, and then disobeyed a direct order from God (Exod. 2:12; Num. 20:11). These “inventions” prevented him from entering the Promised Land. Aaron--believing that “government of the people and by the people” should be for “the people”--succumbed  mob rule and built a golden calf (an “invention” if you ever saw one, Exod. 32:1--6), and consequently experienced what Moses
experienced: both of them died without
entering the Promised Land. 
 \cite{Ruckman1992psalms}} \footnote{The word``'inventions'' is used five times in scripture: Here, Psalm 106:29 (\textbf{Psalm 106:29} - Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.), Psalm 106:39 (\textbf{Psalm 106:39} -- Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.), Proverbs 8:12 (\textbf{Proverbs 8:12} -- I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. ), and Ecclesiastes 7:29 (\textbf{Ecclesiastes 7:29} -- Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.) In addition, the word ``invented'' is found in 2 Chronicles 26:15 (\textbf{2 Chronicles 26:15} -- And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.) and the word ``inventors'' is used in Romans 1:30 (\textbf{Romans 1:30} -- Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,).}
